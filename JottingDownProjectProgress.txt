1. created a folder "Recipes_ChicagoRestaurants_etc". 
2. Created two subfolders "AnnRecipes" and "AnnRestaurants". Within "AnnRestaurants", created two subfolders "TacoRestaurantsTried" and "TacoRestaurantsWishList". 
3. Did a git bash here in the folder "Recipes_ChicagoRestaurants_etc". Did a "git init" there. 
4. Created this text and started jotting down each action. 
5. I did a git status, it only seemed to track files. Did not track folders. 
6. Tried renaming the master branch using the command
	 "git branch -m AnnBranch"
got the error
error: refname refs/heads/master not found
fatal: Branch rename failed

Summary of my activity: created a new git repo; and without any commits tried to rename the master branch and got the above error. 

Stack Overflow Solution: 
"You are currently in detached head state. You must checkout a new branch to associate it with the current commit:

git checkout -b new_branch"

Hence, did a 
	git checkout -b new_branch

At this point, git branch does not show "master" and "anngrg126_Branch" branches. 
"git status" shows "On branch anngrg126_Branch"

I'm going to try my first commit now. 

Okay, so after commit. when you do a git branch; you do not see master and just see "anngrg126_Branch"


7. Added LambCurry.txt recipe to the folder AnnRecipes. Did a git status. LambCurry.txt is untracked because we've not staged it yet. It does not show as LambCurry.txt file. But shows there are untracked files in AnnRecipes/. So I guess folder structure does exist in git. 

Doing a cd into AnnRecipes folder and doing git status again. Still does not show LambCurry.txt file is untracked. Instead says ./ (still in folder format) is untracked. 

I did a git add with the name of LambCurry.txt , not when you do a git status it shows new file with LambCurry.txt and modified Jotting File. 

8. To stage files, you have to go into individual folders. even if you do git add . from within one folder, it doesn't add files in other folder.
