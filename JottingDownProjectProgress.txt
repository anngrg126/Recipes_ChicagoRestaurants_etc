1. created a folder "Recipes_ChicagoRestaurants_etc". 
2. Created two subfolders "AnnRecipes" and "AnnRestaurants". Within "AnnRestaurants", created two subfolders "TacoRestaurantsTried" and "TacoRestaurantsWishList". 
3. Did a git bash here in the folder "Recipes_ChicagoRestaurants_etc". Did a "git init" there. 
4. Created this text and started jotting down each action. 
5. I did a git status, it only seemed to track files. Did not track folders. 
6. Tried renaming the master branch using the command
	 "git branch -m AnnBranch"
got the error
error: refname refs/heads/master not found
fatal: Branch rename failed

Summary of my activity: created a new git repo; and without any commits tried to rename the master branch and got the above error. 

Stack Overflow Solution: 
"You are currently in detached head state. You must checkout a new branch to associate it with the current commit:

git checkout -b new_branch"

Hence, did a 
	git checkout -b new_branch
